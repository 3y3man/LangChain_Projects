# LangChain Projects

Welcome to my LangChain Projects repository! This repo showcases a variety of projects utilizing the LangChain framework, demonstrating my skills in natural language processing, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.

## Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own folder, with a detailed README file explaining the purpose, functionality, and setup instructions. The only exception is the "Misc" folder, which contains various scripts and utilities without specific project descriptions.

### Highlights

- **SQL Query with Spotify**: A project that integrates Spotify's API with LangChain to generate SQL queries based on user input, allowing for dynamic music data analysis.
- **RAG with History**: This project demonstrates the use of retrieval-augmented generation techniques, incorporating historical context into generated responses.
- **Detective**: A fun and interactive project where users can engage with a detective AI, leveraging LangChain's capabilities to solve fictional mysteries.
- **Misc**: Various experiments and utilities using LangChain, showcasing the versatility of the framework.
