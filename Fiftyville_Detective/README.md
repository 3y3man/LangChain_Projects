This project is inspired by the CS50x Fiftyville Problem Set:
[CS50x Fiftyville Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/7/fiftyville/)

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook guides you through setting up a Python environment for a fictional crime investigation scenario. The project involves querying a database to solve a case and demonstrates the use of LangChain and OpenAI tools.

## Contents

1. **Libraries: Install**  
   Instructions for installing necessary packages, including:
   - `langchain`
   - `langchain-community`
   - `langchain-openai`
   - `langchainhub`

2. **Libraries: Import**  
   Importing essential modules from LangChain and other libraries.

3. **Connect: OpenAI**  
   Setting up OpenAI API key and choosing a language model (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`).

4. **Connect: Database**  
   Connecting to the SQLite database containing fictional crime data.

5. **Inspect Database**  
   Instructions on exploring the database schema and data.

6. **Constructing a Query Chain**  
   Creating a chain of operations to query and analyze the data using LangChain components.

## Usage
To run the notebook, ensure you have the necessary packages installed and an active OpenAI API key. The notebook guides you through connecting to the database, exploring the data, and utilizing LangChain for analyzing the crime scenario.
