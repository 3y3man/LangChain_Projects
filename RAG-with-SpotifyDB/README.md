# Spotify Streams Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing Spotify streaming data using various data processing and visualization techniques. The project utilizes a dataset of Spotify streams, stored in a SQLite database, and includes a Jupyter notebook for querying and visualizing the data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have Python installed on your local machine.
- You have Jupyter Notebook installed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/3y3man/LangChains/spotify-streams-analysis.git
    cd spotify-streams-analysis
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Project Structure

- `spotifystreams.csv`: A CSV file containing the Spotify streams data.
- `spotify.db`: A SQLite database file containing the data.
- `sql_query_with_spotify.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to query and analyze the data using SQL and Python.

## Usage

To start the Jupyter notebook, use the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook sql_query_with_spotify.ipynb
```

This will open the notebook in your default web browser, where you can explore the data and run the analyses.
